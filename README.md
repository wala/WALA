WALA [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wala/WALA.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wala/WALA) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/WALAHelp/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/WALAHelp/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/WALAHelp/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
=====================

This is the main source repository for WALA.  For more details on WALA, see <a
href="http://wala.sourceforge.net">the WALA home page</a> and <a href="https://wala.github.io/javadoc">WALA Javadoc</a>.

WALA uses Gradle as its build system.  If you intend to modify or
build WALA yourself, then see [the Gradle-specific
README](README-Gradle.md) for more instructions and helpful tips.  You
may also find `build.xml` configuration files for Maven builds, but
Maven is no longer well supported; use Gradle if at all possible.
