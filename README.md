=====================

This is the main source repository for WALA.  For more details on WALA, see [the WALA home page](http://wala.sourceforge.net) and [WALA Javadoc](https://wala.github.io/javadoc).

WALA uses Gradle as its build system.  If you intend to modify or
build WALA yourself, then see [the Gradle-specific
README](README-Gradle.md) for more instructions and helpful tips.  You
may also find `build.xml` configuration files for Maven builds, but
Maven is no longer well supported; use Gradle if at all possible.
