Two license agreements are presented below.<br>
<br>
1. IBM International License Agreement for Evaluation of 
Programs<br>
2. IBM International Program License Agreement<br>
<br>
If you are obtaining the Program for purposes of productive 
use (other than evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or 
demonstration): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, You accept the 
IBM International Program License Agreement, without 
modification.<br>
<br>
If you are obtaining the Program for the purpose of 
evaluation, testing, trial "try or buy," or demonstration 
(collectively, an "Evaluation"): By clicking on the "Accept" button below, 
You accept both (i) the IBM International License Agreement for 
Evaluation of Programs (the "Evaluation License"), without 
modification; and (ii) the IBM International Program License Agreement 
(the "IPLA"), without modification. <br>
<br>
The Evaluation License will apply during the term of Your 
Evaluation. <br>
<br>
The IPLA will automatically apply if You elect to retain 
the Program after the Evaluation (or obtain additional copies 
of the Program for use after the Evaluation) by entering into 
a procurement agreement (e.g., the IBM International Passport 
Advantage or the IBM Passport Advantage Express agreements). <br>
<br>
The Evaluation License and the IPLA are not in effect 
concurrently; neither modifies the other; and each is independent of the 
other.<br>
<br>
The complete text of each of these two license agreements 
follow.<br>
<br>
<br>
International License Agreement for Evaluation of Programs<br>
<br>
Part 1 - General Terms<br>
<br>
BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, OR USING 
THE PROGRAM YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU 
ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER PERSON OR A 
COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU 
HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND THAT PERSON, COMPANY, OR LEGAL 
ENTITY TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, <br>
<br>
- DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, OR USE THE 
PROGRAM; AND<br>
<br>
- PROMPTLY RETURN THE PROGRAM TO THE PARTY FROM WHOM YOU 
ACQUIRED IT. IF YOU DOWNLOADED THE PROGRAM, CONTACT THE PARTY FROM 
WHOM YOU ACQUIRED IT.<br>
<br>
"IBM" is International Business Machines Corporation or one 
of its subsidiaries.<br>
<br>
"License Information" ("LI") is a document that provides 
information specific to a Program. The Program's LI is available in a 
file in the Program's directory, by the use of a system command, 
or as a booklet which accompanies the Program. The LI may also 
be found at http://www.ibm.com/software/sla/ .<br>
<br>
"Program" is the following, including the original and all 
whole or partial copies: 1) machine-readable instructions and 
data, 2) components, 3) audio-visual content (such as images, 
text, recordings, or pictures), 4) related licensed materials, 
and 5) license use documents or keys, and documentation.<br>
<br>
"You" and "Your" refer either to an individual person or to 
a single legal entity.<br>
<br>
This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - 
Country-unique Terms (if any), and License Information and is the 
complete agreement between You and IBM regarding the use of the 
Program. It replaces any prior oral or written communications 
between You and IBM concerning Your use of the Program. The terms 
of Part 2 and License Information may replace or modify those 
of Part 1. <br>
<br>
1. Entitlement<br>
<br>
License<br>
<br>
The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is 
copyrighted and licensed, not sold.<br>
<br>
IBM grants You a nonexclusive license to use the Program 
when You lawfully acquire it.<br>
<br>
You may 1) use the Program only for internal evaluation, 
testing, or demonstration purposes, on a trial or "try-and-buy" 
basis; and 2) make and install a reasonable number of copies, 
including a backup copy, of the Program to support such use. The 
terms of this license apply to each copy You make. You will 
reproduce all copyright notices and all other legends of ownership on 
each copy, or partial copy, of the Program.<br>
<br>
THE PROGRAM MAY CONTAIN A DISABLING DEVICE THAT WILL 
PREVENT IT FROM BEING USED AFTER THE EVALUATION PERIOD ENDS. YOU 
WILL NOT TAMPER WITH THIS DISABLING DEVICE OR THE PROGRAM. YOU 
SHOULD TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT MIGHT 
RESULT WHEN THE PROGRAM CAN NO LONGER BE USED.<br>
<br>
You will 1) maintain a record of all copies of the Program 
and 2) ensure that anyone who uses the Program (accessed either 
locally or remotely) does so only for Your authorized use and 
complies with the terms of this Agreement.<br>
<br>
You may not 1) use, copy, modify or distribute the Program 
except as provided in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse 
compile, or otherwise translate the Program except as specifically 
permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; or 3) 
sublicense, rent, or lease the Program.<br>
<br>
The evaluation period begins when You agree to the terms of 
this Agreement and ends 1) as of the duration or date specified 
in the License Information, or 2) when the Program 
automatically disables itself. There is no charge for the use of the 
Program for the duration of the evaluation period. Unless IBM 
specifies in the License Information that You may retain the Program, 
You will destroy the Program and all copies made of it within 
ten days of the end of the evaluation period. If IBM specifies 
that You may retain the Program, and You elect to do so, the 
Program will be then subject to a different license agreement, that 
will be provided to You at that time. In addition, a charge may 
apply.<br>
<br>
IBM may terminate Your license if You fail to comply with 
the terms of this Agreement. If IBM does so, You must destroy 
all copies of the Program.<br>
<br>
2. No Warranty<br>
<br>
SUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES WHICH CANNOT BE 
EXCLUDED, IBM MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS EITHER EXPRESS OR 
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR 
CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND 
NON-INFRINGEMENT, REGARDING THE PROGRAM OR TECHNICAL SUPPORT, 
IF ANY.<br>
<br>
The exclusion also applies to any of IBM's Program 
developers and suppliers.<br>
<br>
Manufacturers, suppliers, or publishers of non-IBM Programs 
may provide their own warranties.<br>
<br>
IBM does not provide technical support, unless IBM 
specifies otherwise.<br>
<br>
3. Limitation of Liability<br>
<br>
Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on 
IBM's part or other liability, You are entitled to recover 
damages from IBM. In each such instance, regardless of the basis on 
which You may be entitled to claim damages from IBM, (including 
fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract or 
tort claim), IBM is liable for no more than 1) damages for 
bodily injury (including death) and damage to real property and 
tangible personal property and 2) the amount of any other actual 
direct damages up to the charges for the Program that is the 
subject of the claim.<br>
<br>
This limitation of liability also applies to IBM's Program 
developers and suppliers. It is the maximum for which they and IBM are 
collectively responsible.<br>
<br>
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR 
SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR 
POSSIBILITY: <br>
<br>
1. LOSS OF, OR DAMAGE TO, DATA;<br>
<br>
2. SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY 
ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; OR<br>
<br>
3. LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR 
ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.<br>
<br>
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION 
OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE 
LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
<br>

<br>
1. Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights 
of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract.<br>

held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of 
this Agreement remain in full force and effect.<br>
<br>
3. You may not export the Program.<br>
<br>
4. You agree to allow IBM to store and use Your contact 
information, including names, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses, 
anywhere they do business. Such information will be processed and 
used in connection with our business relationship, and may be 
provided to contractors, Business Partners, and assignees of IBM for 
uses consistent with their collective business activities, 
including communicating with You (for example, for processing orders, 
for promotions, and for market research).<br>
<br>
5. Neither You nor IBM will bring a legal action under this 
Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose unless 
otherwise provided by local law without the possibility of 
contractual waiver or limitation.<br>
<br>
6. Neither You nor IBM is responsible for failure to 
fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control.<br>

action for any third party, nor will IBM be responsible for any 
third party claims against You except, as permitted by the

International Program License Agreement<br>
<br>
Part 1 - General Terms<br>
<br>
BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, OR USING 
THE PROGRAM YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU 
ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER PERSON OR A 
COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU 
HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO BIND THAT PERSON, COMPANY, OR LEGAL 
ENTITY TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, <br>
<br>
- DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, COPY, ACCESS, OR USE THE 
PROGRAM; AND<br>
<br>
- PROMPTLY RETURN THE PROGRAM AND PROOF OF ENTITLEMENT TO 
THE PARTY FROM WHOM YOU ACQUIRED IT TO OBTAIN A REFUND OF THE 
AMOUNT YOU PAID. IF YOU DOWNLOADED THE PROGRAM, CONTACT THE PARTY 
FROM WHOM YOU ACQUIRED IT.<br>
<br>
"IBM" is International Business Machines Corporation or one 
of its subsidiaries.<br>
<br>
"License Information" ("LI") is a document that provides 
information specific to a Program. The Program's LI is available at 
http://www.ibm.com/software/sla/ . The LI may also be found in a 
file in the Program's directory, by the use of a system command, 
or as a booklet which accompanies the Program.<br>
<br>
"Program" is the following, including the original and all 
whole or partial copies: 1) machine-readable instructions and 
data, 2) components, 3) audio-visual content (such as images, 
text, recordings, or pictures), 4) related licensed materials, 
and 5) license use documents or keys, and documentation.<br>
<br>
A "Proof of Entitlement" ("PoE") is evidence of Your 
authorization to use a Program at a specified level. That level may be 
measured, for example, by the number of processors or users. The PoE 
is also evidence of Your eligibility for warranty, future 
upgrade prices, if any, and potential special or promotional 
opportunities. If IBM does not provide You with a PoE, then IBM may accept 
the original paid sales receipt or other sales record from the 
party (either IBM or its reseller) from whom You acquired the 
Program, provided that it specifies the name of the Program and the 
usage level acquired. <br>
<br>
"You" and "Your" refer either to an individual person or to 
a single legal entity.<br>
<br>
This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms, Part 2 - 
Country-unique Terms (if any), License Information, and Proof of 
Entitlement and is the complete agreement between You and IBM regarding 
the use of the Program. It replaces any prior oral or written 
communications between You and IBM concerning Your use of the Program. The 
terms of Part 2 and License Information may replace or modify 
those of Part 1. To the extent there is a conflict between the 
terms of this Agreement and those of the IBM International 
Passport Advantage Agreement, the terms of the latter agreement 
prevail.<br>
<br>
1. Entitlement<br>
<br>
License<br>
<br>
The Program is owned by IBM or an IBM supplier, and is 
copyrighted and licensed, not sold.<br>
<br>
IBM grants You a nonexclusive license to use the Program 
when You lawfully acquire it.<br>
<br>
You may 1) use the Program up to the level of use specified 
in the PoE and 2) make and install copies, including a backup 
copy, to support such use. The terms of this license apply to 
each copy You make. You will reproduce all copyright notices and 
all other legends of ownership on each copy, or partial copy, 
of the Program.<br>
<br>
If You acquire the Program as a program upgrade, after You 
install the upgrade You may not use the Program from which You 
upgraded or transfer it to another party.<br>
<br>
You will ensure that anyone who uses the Program (accessed 
either locally or remotely) does so only for Your authorized use 
and complies with the terms of this Agreement.<br>
<br>
You may not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program 
except as provided in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble, reverse 
compile, or otherwise translate the Program except as specifically 
permitted by law without the possibility of contractual waiver; or 3) 
sublicense, rent, or lease the Program.<br>
<br>
IBM may terminate Your license if You fail to comply with 
the terms of this Agreement. If IBM does so, You must destroy 
all copies of the Program and its PoE.<br>
<br>
Money-back Guarantee<br>
<br>
If for any reason You are dissatisfied with the Program and 
You are the original licensee, You may obtain a refund of the 
amount You paid for it, if within 30 days of Your invoice date You 
return the Program and its PoE to the party from whom You obtained 
it. If You downloaded the Program, You may contact the party 
from whom You acquired it for instructions on how to obtain the 
refund.<br>
<br>
Program Transfer<br>
<br>
You may transfer a Program and all of Your license rights 
and obligations to another party only if that party agrees to 
the terms of this Agreement. When You transfer the Program, You 
must also transfer a copy of this Agreement, including the 
Program's PoE. After the transfer, You may not use the Program.<br>
<br>
2. Charges<br>
<br>
The amount payable for a Program license is a one-time 
charge. <br>
<br>
One-time charges are based on the level of use acquired 
which is specified in the PoE. IBM does not give credits or 
refunds for charges already due or paid, except as specified 
elsewhere in this Agreement.<br>
<br>
If You wish to increase the level of use, notify IBM or the 
party from whom You acquired it and pay any applicable charges. <br>
<br>
If any authority imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee, 
excluding those based on IBM's net income, upon the Program, then You 
agree to pay the amount specified or supply exemption 
documentation. You are responsible for any personal property taxes for the 
Program from the date that You acquire it.<br>
<br>
3. Limited Warranty<br>
<br>
IBM warrants that when the Program is used in the specified 
operating environment it will conform to its specifications. The 
warranty applies only to the unmodified portion of the Program. IBM 
does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation of the 
Program or that IBM will correct all Program defects. You are 
responsible for the results obtained from the use of the Program. <br>
<br>
IBM provides You with access to IBM databases containing 
information on known Program defects, defect corrections, restrictions, 
and bypasses at no additional charge. Consult the IBM Software 
Support Guide for further information at http://www.ibm.
com/software/support . IBM will maintain this information for at least one year 
after the original licensee acquires the Program ("Warranty 
Period").<br>
<br>
If the Program does not function as warranted during the 
Warranty Period and the problem cannot be resolved with information 
available in the IBM databases, You may return the Program and its 
PoE to the party (either IBM or its reseller) from whom You 
acquired it and receive a refund in the amount You paid. If You 
downloaded the Program, You may contact the party from whom You 
acquired it for instructions on how to obtain the refund. <br>
<br>
THESE WARRANTIES ARE YOUR EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES AND REPLACE 
ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF 
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. SOME STATES OR 
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN THAT EVENT, 
SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE WARRANTY PERIOD. 
NO WARRANTIES APPLY AFTER THAT PERIOD. SOME STATES OR 
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY 
LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
<br>
THESE WARRANTIES GIVE YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS AND YOU MAY 
ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE OR 
JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.<br>
<br>
4. Limitation of Liability<br>
<br>
Circumstances may arise where, because of a default on 
IBM's part or other liability, You are entitled to recover 
damages from IBM. In each such instance, regardless of the basis on 
which You may be entitled to claim damages from IBM, (including 
fundamental breach, negligence, misrepresentation, or other contract or 
tort claim), IBM is liable for no more than 1) damages for 
bodily injury (including death) and damage to real property and 
tangible personal property and 2) the amount of any other actual 
direct damages up to the charges for the Program that is the 
subject of the claim.<br>
<br>
This limitation of liability also applies to IBM's Program 
developers and suppliers. It is the maximum for which they and IBM are 
collectively responsible.<br>
<br>
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS IBM, ITS PROGRAM DEVELOPERS OR 
SUPPLIERS LIABLE FOR ANY OF THE FOLLOWING, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR 
POSSIBILITY: <br>

2. SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY 
ECONOMIC CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; OR<br>
<br>
3. LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, OR 
ANTICIPATED SAVINGS.<br>
<br>
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION 
OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE 
LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
<br>
5. General<br>
<br>
1. Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights 
of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract.<br>

import laws and regulations.<br>

used in connection with our business relationship, and may be 
provided to contractors, Business Partners, and assignees of IBM for 
uses consistent with their collective business activities, 
including communicating with You (for example, for processing orders, 
for promotions, and for market research).<br>
<br>
5. Neither You nor IBM will bring a legal action under this 
Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose unless 
otherwise provided by local law without the possibility of 
contractual waiver or limitation.<br>
<br>
6. Neither You nor IBM is responsible for failure to 
fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control.<br>

third party claims against You except, as permitted by the 
Limitation of Liability section above, for bodily injury (including 
death) or damage to real or tangible personal property for which 
IBM is legally liable.<br>
<br>
6. Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Arbitration<br>
