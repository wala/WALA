 *  A set of classes facilitating the construction of synthetic methods.

 *  The usual methods of creating SummarizedMethods are error-prone and sometimes a bit
 *  Inflexible. The tools provided in this package can be used to generate summarized 
 *  methods in a Type-Safe manner and assure all used methods are resolvable.
 *
 *  Needless to say that this method of generating synthetic methods is much slower than
 *  the regular one.
