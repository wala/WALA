/**
 * A PointerKey instance serves as the representative for an equivalence class of pointers. (or more
 * generally ...locations, if we allow primitives).
 *
 * <p>For example, a PointerKey for 0-CFA might be - a &lt;CGNode,int&gt; pair, where the int
 * represents an SSA value number. This PointerKey would represent all values of the pointer of a
 * particular local variable. - a &lt;FieldReference&gt;, representing the set of instances of a
 * given field in the heap, or of a particular static field.
 *
 * <p>A PointerKey for 0-1-CFA, with 1-level of InstanceVar context in the Grove et al. terminology,
 * would instead of FieldReference, use a - &lt;InstanceKey, FieldReference&gt; pair
