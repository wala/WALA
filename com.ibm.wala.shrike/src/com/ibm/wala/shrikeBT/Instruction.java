/**
 * Instructions are immutable objects. It is always legal to take a reference to an instruction and
 * use it in any other context. You never need to copy instructions. It is often a good idea to keep
 * references to frequently used instructions cached in static fields.
 *
 * <p>To generate an Instruction, locate the class for the instruction you want to generate, and
 * invoke the appropriate "make" static method on that class. The Util class has convenience methods
 * for creating some of the more complex instructions using reflection to fill in some of the needed
 * information (e.g., makeGet, makePut, makeInvoke).
 *
 * <p>We simplify the bytecode instruction set a bit using some preprocessing and postprocessing:
 *
 * <p>There is no 'iinc' instruction. 'iinc' instructions are expanded to 'iload; bipush; iadd;
 * istore' during decoding and reassembled during compilation.
 *
 * <p>There are no 'jsr' or 'ret' instructions. Bytecode subroutines are expanded inline during
 * decoding.
 *
 * <p>There are no 'ifeq', 'ifne', 'ifgt', 'ifge', 'iflt', 'ifle' instructions. These instructions
 * are expanded to 'bipush 0; if_icmp' during decoding and reassembled during compilation.
 *
 * <p>There are no 'ifnull' or 'ifnonnull' instructions. These instructions are expanded to
 * 'aconst_null; if_acmp' during decoding and reassembled during compilation.
 *
 * <p>All Java values, including longs and doubles, occupy just one word on the stack. Places where
 * the JVM assumes differently are fixed up during compilation. However, longs and double still take
 * up two local variable slots (this usually doesn't matter to instrumentation).
 *
 * <p>Control transfer instructions refer to target instructions using integers. These integers are
 * usually indices into an array of instructions.
