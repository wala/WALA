/**
 * If we want to filter edges of a control flow graph we already have {@link
 * com.ibm.wala.ipa.cfg.EdgeFilter}, but if we want to remove exceptions in particular we may want
 * to combine different analysis. Therefore we need a possibility to collect a set of removed
 * exceptions, so that an exceptional edge may be removed as soon as all exceptions, which can occur
 * along these edge are filtered.
 *
 * <p>This package contains classes for this job and also adapter for some analysis.
