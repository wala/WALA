Contributing to WALA
====================

WALA welcomes contributions of all kinds and sizes. This includes
everything from simple bug reports to large features.

Workflow
--------

We love GitHub issues!

For small feature requests, an issue first proposing it for discussion
or demo implementation in a PR suffice.

For big features, please open an issue so that we can agree on the
direction, and hopefully avoid investing a lot of time on a feature
that might need reworking.

Small pull requests for things like typos, bug fixes, etc are always welcome.

Additional Checks
-----------------

Beyond tests, other checks run as part of `./gradlew check` and
`./gradlew build`, including:

1. Compilation with the Java compiler from [Eclipse JDT
   Core](https://www.eclipse.org/jdt/core/), which runs additional
   lint checks

1. Checking that all Java and Kotlin code is formatted according to
   [Google Java Format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format)
   and [ktfmt](https://facebook.github.io/ktfmt/) standards,
   respectively.

If your code fails check 2, you can run `./gradlew spotlessApply` to
automatically format it.  The CI job runs `./gradlew build` and will
fail if any of these additional checks fail.

DOs and DON'Ts
--------------

* DO format your Java and Kotlin code using [Google Java
  Format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) and
  [ktfmt](https://facebook.github.io/ktfmt/), respectively.  A CI job
  will fail if your code is not formatted in this way.

* DO include tests when adding new features. When fixing bugs, start
  with adding a test that highlights how the current behavior is
  broken.

* DO keep the discussions focused. When a new or related topic comes
  up it's often better to create new issue than to side track the
  discussion.

* DO make liberal use of Javadoc and comments to document code.

* DO use the `com.ibm.wala.util.debug.Assertions` class liberally. All
  calls to `assert()` must be guarded by
  `Assertions.verifyAssertions`. Use the `productionAssert`
  entrypoints for assertions that should be enabled in production, and
  thus not guarded.

* DO make code deterministic.  Construct `HashMap`s and `HashSet`s
  using `com.ibm.wala.util.collections.HashMapFactory.make()` and
  `com.ibm.wala.util.collections.HashSetFactory.make()` respectively.
  Avoid use of `System.identityHashCode()` and finalizers.

* DON'T write to `System.out` or `System.err`. Use the
  `com.ibm.wala.util.debug.Trace` facility to write debugging and
  trace messages.

* DON'T submit PRs that alter licensing related files or headers. If
  you believe there's a problem with them, file an issue and we'll be
  happy to discuss it.

Guiding Principles
------------------

* We allow anyone to participate in our projects. Tasks can be carried
  out by anyone that demonstrates the capability to complete them.

* Always be respectful of one another. Assume the best in others and
  act with empathy at all times

* Collaborate closely with individuals maintaining the project or
  experienced users. Getting ideas out in the open and seeing a
  proposal before it's a pull request helps reduce redundancy and
  ensures we're all connected to the decision making process
