/**

 *  
 *  It is like a "regular" AndroidModel but the calls are restricted to EntryPoints whose target-class
 *  is of the type of the given AndroidComponent.
 *
 *  In the ClassHierarchy a MiniModel will be known as "AndroidModelClass.???Model" (where ??? is the
 *  AndroidComponent) and be called by "AndroidModelClass.startUnknown???" (which is generated by the 
 *  UnknownTargetModel).
 *
 *  A MiniModel is used when a startComponent-call (startActivity, bindService, ...) is encountered, but
 *  the Context at the call site is insufficient to determine the actual target. In this case an 
 *  UnknownTargetModel which uses an MiniModel and an ExternalModel is placed there.
