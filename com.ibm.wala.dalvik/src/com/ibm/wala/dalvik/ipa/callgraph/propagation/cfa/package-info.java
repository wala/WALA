/**
 * Fetch and handle information on Android-Intents.
 *
 * <p>Collects the new-Sites of Intents and tries to resolve the parameters to the Intents
 * constructor.
 *
 * <p>When a startComponent-function is encountered this information is used to redirect the call to
 * an AndroidModel (optionally syntethized at this point). For this to happen a wrapper is
 * synthesized using AndroidModels getMethodAs- Function.
 *
 * <p>If the target could not be determined definitely all components of the application matching
 * the type of the startComponent-call are invoked.
 *
 * <p>The specification on which startComponent-calls are known may be found in IntentStarters.
 *
 * <p>A context-free variant of the redirection of startComponent-calls may be found in the
 * Overrides mentioned below.
